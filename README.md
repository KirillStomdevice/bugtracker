# Dortania Bugtracker

The goal of this bugtracker is 2 things:

* Centralise both guide issues and suggestions
* Centralise both issues and solutions for systems

Please note bug reports involving the following are not supported:

* Non-Acidanthera boot loaders at the moment only OpenCore is supported
  * ie. Chameleon, Clover, Ozmozis or alike
  * Forks of OpenCore are also not supported
* Distros and other "non-vanilla" installation methods
  * ie. iAtkos, Niresh, Unibeast, Multtibeast or alike

## When to use issue [Acidanthera's tracker](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker)

* You have new resources or patches to add but cannot make a pull request
* You have kernel panics, crashes, hangs and believe it is not a configuration issue
* You want to discuss technical or legal stuff regarding Acidanthera projects
